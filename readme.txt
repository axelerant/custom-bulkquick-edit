Through Custom Bulk/Quick Edit, you have the option to edit post meta via text, checkbox, radio, select, and textarea inputs within Bulk Edit and Quick Edit screens. Further, you can enable editing of category and tag taxonomies that don't show up already.

This is very helpful when you want to mass reset or remove information.

**[Video introduction](http://youtu.be/UXvzdlvIPtk)**

Custom Bulk/Quick Edit automatically detects custom fields that use the [manage_{$post_type}_posts_columns](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/manage_$post_type_posts_columns) filter to display additional columns on the edit screen. Therefore, unless it's already configured, your theme's `functions.php` file will have to modified to add custom field columns.

= Help Me, Help You =

Do [let me know](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/custom-bulkquick-edit) how well you're able to use this plugin or not. 

This plugin grew out of the frustration of having to custom write this code for every client. It works best when the custom post types have already added columns to the edit screen via the [manage_{$post_type}_posts_columns](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/manage_$post_type_posts_columns) filter.

[Example](https://aihrus.zendesk.com/entries/24800411-How-do-I-add-custom-columns-).

= Limitations =

Unless the [manage_{$post_type}_posts_columns](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/manage_$post_type_posts_columns) is already configured, your theme's `functions.php` file will have to modified to add custom field columns.

I need beta testers to help with ensuring pending releases of Custom Bulk/Quick Edit and Custom Bulk/Quick Edit Premium are solid. This would benefit us all by helping reduce the number of releases and raise code quality.

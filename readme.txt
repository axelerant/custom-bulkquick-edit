**[Video introduction](http://youtu.be/UXvzdlvIPtk)**

Custom Bulk/Quick Edit automatically detects custom fields that use the [manage_{$post_type}_posts_columns](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/manage_$post_type_posts_columns) filter to display additional columns on the edit screen. Therefore, unless it's already configured, your theme's `functions.php` file will have to modified to add custom field columns.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.3.0 =

* Requires PHP 5.3+ [notice](https://aihrus.zendesk.com/entries/30678006)

= 1.1.0 =

* Please review your settings as some option keys have changed. There's no auto-upgrade at this time.

== Notes ==

* This plugin ties into the [bulk_edit_custom_box](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/bulk_edit_custom_box) and [quick_edit_custom_box](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/quick_edit_custom_box) actions.
* Unless the [manage_{$post_type}_posts_columns](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/manage_$post_type_posts_columns) is already configured, your theme's `functions.php` file will have to modified to add custom field columns.


== API ==

* Read the [Custom Bulk/Quick Edit API](https://github.com/michael-cannon/custom-bulkquick-edit/blob/master/API.md).


== Background ==

This plugin grew out of the frustration of having to custom write this code for every client. It works best when the custom post types have already added columns to the edit screen via the [manage_{$post_type}_posts_columns](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/manage_$post_type_posts_columns) filter.


== Localization ==

* Serbo-Croatian by [Borisa Djuraskovic](borisad@webhostinghub.com)

You can translate this plugin into your own language if it's not done so already. The localization file `custom-bulkquick-edit.pot` can be found in the `languages` folder of this plugin. After translation, please [send the localized file](http://aihr.us/contact-aihrus/) for plugin inclusion.

== Beta Testers Needed ==

I really want Custom Bulk/Quick Edit and Custom Bulk/Quick Edit Premium to be the best WordPress plugins of their type. However, it's beyond me to do it alone.

I need beta testers to help with ensuring pending releases of Custom Bulk/Quick Edit and Custom Bulk/Quick Edit Premium are solid. This would benefit us all by helping reduce the number of releases and raise code quality.

[Please contact me directly](http://aihr.us/contact-aihrus/).

Beta testers benefit directly with latest versions, a free 1-site license for Custom Bulk/Quick Edit Premium, and personalized support assistance.

== TODO ==

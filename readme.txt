Custom Bulk/Quick Edit allows you to easily add custom fields to the edit screen bulk and quick edit panels.


== Description ==

Through Custom Bulk/Quick Edit [by Aihrus](http://aihr.us/about-aihrus/), you have the option to edit post meta via text, checkbox, radio, select, and textarea inputs within Bulk Edit and Quick Edit screens. Further, you can enable editing of category and tag taxonomies that don't show up already. Next, taxnomony, checkbox, radio, and select fields have an option to be reset, as in remove current options during Bulk Editing. This is very helpful when you want to mass reset or remove information.

**Video Introduction**

Custom Bulk/Quick Edit automatically detects custom fields that use the [manage_{$post_type}_posts_columns](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/manage_$post_type_posts_columns) filter to display additional columns on the edit screen. **Therefore, unless it's already configured, your theme's `functions.php` file will have to modified to add custom field columns.**

Read the **Usage** section of [Installation](http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-bulkquick-edit/installation/) and the **[FAQ](http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-bulkquick-edit/faq/)** to get started.

== Changelog ==

Read [Changelog](https://github.com/michael-cannon/custom-bulk-quick-edit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)


== Upgrade Notice ==

TBD


== Notes ==

* This plugin ties into the [bulk_edit_custom_box](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/bulk_edit_custom_box) and [quick_edit_custom_box](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/quick_edit_custom_box) actions.
* Unless the [manage_{$post_type}_posts_columns](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/manage_$post_type_posts_columns) is already configured, your theme's `functions.php` file will have to modified to add custom field columns.


== API ==

* Read the [Custom Bulk/Quick Edit API](https://github.com/michael-cannon/custom-bulkquick-edit/blob/master/API.md).


== Background ==

This plugin grew out of the frustration of having to custom write this code for every client. It works best when the custom post types have already added columns to the edit screen via the [manage_{$post_type}_posts_columns](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/manage_$post_type_posts_columns) filter.


== Localization ==

* Spanish translation by [Andrew Kurtis from WebHostingHub](http://www.webhostinghub.com)
* Serbo-Croatian translation by [Borisa Djuraskovic](borisad@webhostinghub.com)

You can translate this plugin into your own language if it's not done so already. The localization file `custom-bulkquick-edit.pot` can be found in the `languages` folder of this plugin. After translation, please [send the localized file](http://aihr.us/contact-aihrus/) for plugin inclusion.
